# What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud computing is a paradigm of IT services delivered via the Internet, encompassing a range of services such as virtual machines, databases, and networking. Unlike traditional data centers that rely on local servers for processing tasks, cloud computing employs remote servers for communication. This eliminates the need for physical data centers, saving costs and providing the flexibility to expand IT infrastructure without the expense of setting up new physical facilities; cloud computing facilitates this seamlessly.
# Shared responsibility model
With traditional datacenter, the company has to responsible for maintaining the physical space, ensuring security, and maintaining or replacing the servers if anything happens which is time-consuming, take lot of effort and money.
With the shared responsibility model, these responsibilities get shared between the cloud provider and the consumer. Physical security, power, cooling, and network connectivity are the responsibility of the cloud provider. The consumer isn’t collocated with the datacenter, so it wouldn’t make sense for the consumer to have any of those responsibilities.
While the cloud provider take all responsibility for the infrastructure, the consumer is responsible for data they store and which actors they allow to access the data.
With an on-premises datacenter, **you’re responsible for everything**. With cloud computing, those responsibilities shift. The shared responsibility model is heavily tied into the cloud service types (covered later in this learning path): infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). 
> IaaS places the most responsibility on the consumer, with the cloud provider being responsible for the basics of physical security, power, and connectivity. On the other end of the spectrum, SaaS places most of the responsibility with the cloud provider. PaaS, being a middle ground between IaaS and SaaS, rests somewhere in the middle and evenly distributes responsibility between the cloud provider and the consumer.

# Cloud Models
## Private Cloud
The private cloud is the evolution of on-prem datacenter. The organizations have the full control over private cloud but required them to hosted on-site or off-site and use remote control. 
While on-premise refers to traditional infrastructure where everything is physically located within the organization, a private cloud is a virtualized environment that offers the benefits of cloud computing but is exclusively dedicated to a single organization, providing increased control and security.
## Public Cloud
A public cloud is built, controlled, and maintained by a third-party cloud provider. With a public cloud, anyone that wants to purchase cloud services can access and use resources. The general public availability is a key difference between public and private clouds.
## Hybrid Cloud
A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that uses both public and private clouds in an inter-connected environment. A hybrid cloud environment can be used to allow a private cloud to surge for increased, temporary demand by deploying public cloud resources. Hybrid cloud can be used to provide an extra layer of security. For example, users can flexibly choose which services to keep in public cloud and which to deploy to their private cloud infrastructure.

|**Public cloud**|**Private cloud**|**Hybrid cloud**|
|---|---|---|
|No capital expenditures to scale up|Organizations have complete control over resources and security|Provides the most flexibility|
|Applications can be quickly provisioned and deprovisioned|Data is not collocated with other organizations’ data|Organizations determine where to run their applications|
|Organizations pay only for what they use|Hardware must be purchased for startup and maintenance|Organizations control security, compliance, or legal requirements|
|Organizations don’t have complete control over resources and security|Organizations are responsible for hardware maintenance and updates|

# Benefits of using cloud computing
## High Availability
When you’re architecting your solution, you’ll need to account for service availability guarantees. Azure is a highly available cloud environment with uptime guarantees depending on the service. These guarantees are part of the service-level agreements (SLAs).
## Scalability
Scalability refers to the ability to adjust resources to meet demand. If you suddenly experience peak traffic and your systems are overwhelmed, the ability to scale means you can add more resources to better handle the increased demand.

The other benefit of scalability is that you aren't overpaying for services. Because the cloud is a consumption-based model, you only pay for what you use. If demand drops off, you can reduce your resources and thereby reduce your costs.
### Vertical scaling

With vertical scaling, if you were developing an app and you needed more processing power, you could vertically scale up to add more CPUs or RAM to the virtual machine. Conversely, if you realized you had over-specified the needs, you could vertically scale down by lowering the CPU or RAM specifications.

### Horizontal scaling

With horizontal scaling, if you suddenly experienced a steep jump in demand, your deployed resources could be scaled out (either automatically or manually). For example, you could add additional virtual machines or containers, scaling out. In the same manner, if there was a significant drop in demand, deployed resources could be scaled in (either automatically or manually), scaling in.
## Reliability
The cloud, by virtue of its decentralized design, naturally supports a reliable and resilient infrastructure. With a decentralized design, the cloud enables you to have resources deployed in regions around the world. With this global scale, even if one region has a catastrophic event other regions are still up and running. You can design your applications to automatically take advantage of this increased reliability. In some cases, your cloud environment itself will automatically shift to a different region for you, with no action needed on your part.
## Predictability
Predictability can be focused on performance predictability or cost predictability.
### Performance
Performance predictability focuses on predicting the resources needed to deliver a positive experience for your customers. Autoscaling, load balancing, and high availability are just some of the cloud concepts that support performance predictability. If you suddenly need more resources, autoscaling can deploy additional resources to meet the demand, and then scale back when the demand drops. Or if the traffic is heavily focused on one area, load balancing will help redirect some of the overload to less stressed areas.
### Cost
Cost predictability is focused on predicting or forecasting the cost of the cloud spend. With the cloud, you can track your resource use in real time, monitor resources to ensure that you’re using them in the most efficient way, and apply data analytics to find patterns and trends that help better plan resource deployments. By operating in the cloud and using cloud analytics and information, you can predict future costs and adjust your resources as needed. You can even use tools like the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) or Pricing Calculator to get an estimate of potential cloud spend.
## Management of the Cloud
Management of the cloud speaks to managing your cloud resources. In the cloud, you can:
- Automatically scale resource deployment based on need.
- Deploy resources based on a preconfigured template, removing the need for manual configuration.
- Monitor the health of resources and automatically replace failing resources.
- Receive automatic alerts based on configured metrics, so you’re aware of performance in real time.
